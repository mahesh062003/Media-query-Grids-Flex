# Web Development Technologies Showcase

This repository contains a simple webpage showcasing various web development technologies. The technologies include **HTML/CSS**, **Node.js**, and **JavaScript**. The page also features interactive buttons to manipulate the content dynamically.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file containing styles for the webpage.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file with functions for dynamic content manipulation.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) follows a basic structure with a title, links to external styles and scripts, and the main content of the page. It includes sections for **HTML/CSS**, **Node.js**, and **JavaScript** technologies.

## CSS Styles

Styles for the webpage are defined in the `styles.css` file. It includes styling for the overall body, headings, container, grid elements, and buttons. The styles provide a visually appealing and responsive design.

## JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file contains functions for handling button clicks and manipulating the grid elements. Functions include removing and adding grid items, changing the background, and displaying an alert on button click.

## Background Image

The background image (`bg.jpeg`) is used to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage. The `body` element in the CSS file defines its properties.

## Responsive Design

The webpage incorporates a responsive design using media queries in the CSS file. The grid layout adjusts for smaller screens, providing an optimal viewing experience.

## Buttons

Several interactive buttons are included on the webpage. They allow users to remove/add grid items and change the background. A button also triggers an alert on click.
